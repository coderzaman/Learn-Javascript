# JavaScript Learning Projects

This repository contains my journey of learning JavaScript, starting from the basics to building six small practical projects. Throughout the learning process, I have taken notes and added comments in the code to explain how the various programs and functions work.

## Overview of Contents:

### Key Topics Covered:
1. **JavaScript Basics** - Covering fundamentals such as variables, operators, data types, and functions.
2. **Control Flow** - Understanding conditional statements and loops.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - Basic OOP principles and how to use objects and methods in JavaScript.
4. **DOM Manipulation** - Working with the Document Object Model to dynamically update web content.
5. **AJAX and Fetch API** - Learning how to make asynchronous calls to APIs.
6. **Regular Expressions** - Using regex to validate user inputs and patterns.

## Completed Projects:

1. **Number-Guesser-Game**:
   - A simple game where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 10 within three attempts.
   - Includes win/lose messages, and disables the play button after the game ends, with a reset option.

2. **Expression-Validation**:
   - A form validation tool using regular expressions.
   - It validates different inputs (e.g., email, phone number, postal code) and shows messages for valid or invalid inputs.

3. **Shopping-Cart**:
   - A localStorage-based shopping cart where users can add or remove products.
   - Displays "Already Added" if the product is in the cart, and gives success messages on addition or removal.

4. **Take-Note**:
   - A note-taking app where users can create and delete notes.
   - Notes are stored in localStorage, and users can search through their saved notes.

5. **Book-List**:
   - A simple app to keep track of books using a form for the book title, author, and ISBN.
   - Books can be added to a list and removed, with data persisted in localStorage. Duplicate ISBNs are not allowed.

6. **GitHub-Finder**:
   - A search tool that uses the GitHub API to fetch user details like avatar, public repositories, followers, etc.
   - Displays a "User Not Found" message if the username is not valid.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coderzaman/JavaScript-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the project in action.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**
- **JavaScript**
- **LocalStorage** for persisting data
- **GitHub API** for the GitHub Finder project

## Learning Notes:
Each folder in this repository contains notes and comments within the code to help understand how different parts of the program work. These notes provide insights into functions, logic, and the structure of each project.
